BACKPACK
========

Backpack is an utility collection and a admin area embedded in a flask-blueprint.

Backpack provides:
* standard css for a admin backend (for example, form styles)
* templates to wrap around a normal blueprint template (for example, base template)

Current TODO
------------

* think about the fact to merge the breadcrumb line with the header line
* clean up the code and the structure
* add style with current web standards
* do something cool
